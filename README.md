# [CLIPSeg](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg) node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

Should hopefully generate a decent mask based on a text input. The mask can then be used for inpainting/outpainting/anything else that relies on a mask.

Please note that I have no idea what I am doing. I cannot guarantee that the install script will work as intended, and I suppose it could potentially break your ComfyUI installation. If you're willing to take that risk, you can go ahead and try installing things by running `python install.py`
